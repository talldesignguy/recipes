Ingredients
3 tablespoons butter, melted and divided
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
3 tablespoons powdered sugar, plus extra for serving
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 cup whole milk, room temperature
3 large eggs, room temperature
Lemon wedges

Directions
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.

Place 2 tablespoons of the melted butter into a 10-inch cast iron skillet
and place in the oven. Set the remaining tablespoon of melted butter aside
to cool slightly. Wait 10 minutes before assembling the other ingredients.

Place the flour, vanilla sugar, salt, milk, eggs and remaining tablespoon
of melted butter into the bowl of a food processor or blender and process
for 30 seconds. Carefully pour the batter into the preheated skillet.
Bake on the middle rack of the oven for 30 minutes or until the edges are
puffed and brown. Sprinkle with additional vanilla sugar and
serve with lemon wedges.
